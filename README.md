# Google Cloud Storage SBT plugin
A SBT resolver and publisher for Google Cloud Storage. The plugin works out of one bucket at the time, this bucket have to be created and configured before using this plugin.

## Authentication with Google Cloud

### Provide download only dependencies 

If you want to provide dependencies for the public the only thing you have to do is to make sure your bucket have public read access rights set. This is done automatically for you if you publish your project using this plugin with the `AccessRights.PublicRead` flag set.

### Publishing and resolving from private buckets

If you want to publish you need to create a service token in the Google Cloud console.

- Create a json token file.
- The service token should be set to "Owner".
- Configure the following environment variable to point at the token json file\
 `export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=<your-file-here>` 
- You may have to logout and then login for the environment variable to be read again. 

## Usage

Add the following to plugins.sbt in your project:


`addSbtPlugin("com.lightbend" % "sbt-google-cloud-storage" % "0.0.10")`

### Using the plugin in your project

To use this plugin as a resolver, add the following to build.sbt.

`resolvers += GCSResolver.forBucket("bucket-name")`

To (optionally) use the plugin to publish artifacts.

`publishTo := Some(GCSPublisher.forBucket("bucket-name",AccessRights.InheritBucket))`

The publisher takes a second parameter that can be either of these values.

- `AccessRights.InheritBucket` - if you want the content to inherit the bucket access rights. 
- `AccessRights.PublicRead` - if you want the content to be publicly available for download.
